    If your gitHub repository has a docs/ folder with gitHub-pages enabled* in the repo settings,
    you can see this file as delivered through a web server
    by using this url pattern:
       https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/webec-hs23/week01/Example.html
                <1>                              <2>         <3>
    <1> User
    <2> Repository
    <3> File					
			
    * You enable gitHub-pages in the repository settings - Options - Github Pages.
      Select the second option: master-branch / docs folder
